The Concise UI has its own set of colors and fonts to standardize the visual experience of the system.

---

## Colors

In terms of color, we chose a set of **basic colors** and a set of **system-level functional colors** to help users of the system quickly form awareness.

```__react
import Colors from '@examples/visual/Colors'; 

ReactDOM.render(<Colors />, mountNode);
```

## Font


In terms of fonts, we use the `Inter` series of fonts made by [@Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/inter/).

It provides a rich **font width** and **font style**, with different font sizes to distinguish the weight of the content, to help users who use the system to improve work efficiency.

```__react
import Font from '@examples/visual/Font'; 

ReactDOM.render(<Font />, mountNode);
```
